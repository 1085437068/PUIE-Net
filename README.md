# PUIE-Net

The implementation of Uncertainty Inspired Underwater Image Enhancement

Download the pretrained model [pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rkGm0l826ybOk_RSJNSZwbKpJc_z2ZkU/view?usp=sharing) and put it in ./weights.

Run Test_MC.py and Test_MP.py to obtain the enhancement results.

To train the model, you need to prepare our [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YXdyNT9ac6CCpQTNKP7SnKtlRyugauvh/view?usp=sharing) first. Then run Train.py.
